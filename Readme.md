# Calculator App

ðŸ§® This is a simple calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library.

## Introduction

The Calculator App provides a basic graphical user interface (GUI) for performing arithmetic calculations. It allows users to input mathematical expressions and obtain the result instantly.

## Features

âœ¨ The Calculator App offers the following features:

1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations.
2. Input of numerical values through buttons.
3. Calculation execution with the "=" button.
4. Real-time result display in a text box.
5. Clearing the calculation using the "C" button.
6. The Enter key can also be used to evaluate the calculation.

## User Interface

The user interface consists of a window with the following components:

1. **Display**: A text box where the user can input the mathematical expression and view the result.

2. **Number Buttons (0-9)**: Buttons labeled with numbers from 0 to 9, enabling the user to input digits into the calculation.

3. **Operation Buttons**: Buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/), used to include corresponding operations in the calculation.

4. **Equal (=) Button**: Pressing this button calculates the result of the expression and displays it in the text box.

5. **Clear (C) Button**: Pressing this button clears the current calculation from the text box.

## How to Use

1. Launch the Calculator App.
2. Use the number buttons (0-9) to input the desired numerical values for the calculation.
3. Use the operation buttons (+, -, \*, /) to include the corresponding operations in the calculation.
4. After entering the desired expression, press the "=" button or hit the Enter key to get the result.
5. To clear the calculation, press the "C" button.
